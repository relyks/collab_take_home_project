## Execution
The project should be runnable by doing the following:

1. `cd <PROJECT DIRECTORY>`

2. `bundle install`

3. `bundle exec rackup`

The default ports for the web server should be listed in the terminal upon startup.

### Requirements
ruby 3.0.3 was used for execution. `rbenv local 3.0.3` was used to install that version to the local project directory. That version may or may not be necessary, but methods from ruby 2.7 were used.
